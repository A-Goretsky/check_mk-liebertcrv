description:
 This check uses SNMP to monitor select air temperature related OID's in Liebert In-Row CRV systems.
 This check pulls from the string-only flexible table in Liebert MIB's.

inventory:
 One check will be created per name_list entry, and individual, respective perfdata will be sent with each.
 Current entries are:
     "Hot Aisle Temperature" 
     "Cold Aisle Temperature" 
     "Air Temperature Set Point"
     "Air Temperature Control Sensor"
 Hot Aisle Temperature refers to the temperature measured at the inlet to the CRV, and Cold at the oulet.
 Feel free to change the names as more understandable -- supply and return felt confusing due to the easy opposite interpretation.

perfometer:
 As the perfdata variable name is "temp" the custom perfometer is overridden by check_mk's own temperature meter.
 If you would like the custom shades listed below, change the perfdata variable name in the check.
 Custom shades of green, yellow, red, and orange have been selected for the perfometer to correspond with
 the states of the check. The values are:
     Green: "#80ff20"
     Yellow: "#ffdf00"
     Red: "#fb4444"
     Orange: "#ff8020"

snmp_scan:
 located in function scan_liebert
 if the "System model identifier" in the flexible table is found, and further contains "liebert", the check will be added
 when inventory is run.
 The "System Model Identifier" is at oid: .1.3.6.1.4.1.476.1.42.3.9.20.1.20.1.2.1.4240

parameters:
 A dictionary with custom parameters that can be overridden:
 factory_settings["liebertcrv_air_temp_params"] = {
    "allAisle_levels": (15, 17, 25, 27),
 }
 The following order is used:
    low crit, low warn, high warn, high crit.
